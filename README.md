# This repository focuses on setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker,Kubernetes (K8s), and Helm. The goal is to automate the deployment process for applications within a K8s cluster. Below are the key components and steps:

# Key Components:

- Jenkins:
The continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) server.
Jenkins jobs are configured to build, test, and deploy applications.

- Docker:
Used for containerization of application code.
Docker images are created for the application.

- Kubernetes (K8s):
The container orchestration platform.
K8s manifests define how the application should be deployed.

- Git:
Version control system for managing code changes.

- Workflow:
-- Developers commit code to the Git repository.
-- Jenkins triggers a pipeline script upon code changes.
-- The pipeline performs the following steps:
 - Builds the application code.
 - Creates a Docker image.
 - Pushes the Docker image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
 - Deploys the Dockerized application to a K8s cluster.

- Helm Folder:
The Helm folder contains Helm charts for managing K8s deployments. Helm simplifies the process of defining, installing, and upgrading applications in K8s. Within the Helm folder, youâ€™ll find charts for different services or components of your application.

# Setup Instructions:
- Create a K8s Cluster using KOPS:
- Set up an Ubuntu EC2 instance.
- Install AWS CLI and KOPS.
- Create an IAM role with necessary permissions.
- Create an S3 bucket for K8s cluster data storage.
- Configure Jenkins:
- Install Jenkins on a separate server.
- Set up Jenkins jobs to build, test, and deploy applications.
- Integrate Jenkins with Git repositories.
- Dockerize Applications:
- Write Dockerfiles for your applications.
- Build Docker images.
- Push images to a Docker registry.
- Deploy to K8s using Helm:
- Define Helm charts for your services.
- Use Helm to install and manage your application components.
